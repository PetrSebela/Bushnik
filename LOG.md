![Bushplane model](/Image/Airplane.png)
- Basic airplane model inspired by Piper PA-18 Super Cub

## 8.10.2025 LOD system
![LOD system Visualization](/Image/LOD.png)
- Layed out rought sketch of terrain system
- Mesh is computed on the GPU (terrain heightmap + mesh triangles)
- Started using [NoiseShader](https://github.com/keijiro/NoiseShader?tab=readme-ov-file) library for noise generation on GPU

## 9.10.2025 Heightmap preview
![Heightmap preview](/Image/Heightmap.png)
- Custom editor window for previewing heightmaps generated by compute shaders
- Basic noise layering and masking

## 24.10.2025 Terrain heightmaps
### Falloff map
The desired island shape is achived by using "falloff" map. This is done by using subtracting value from the terrain sample based on its distance from the center of the island. 

This would normally be described by this equation derived from the analytic equation for circle $$\sqrt{x^2-y^2}$$

By using this function we can achieve the desired look, however the result leaves lot of space in the corners and looks rather circular (duh). This can be fixe by using equation for so called squicle. 
$$ \lvert \frac{x^4}{r_x} \rvert + \lvert \frac{y^4}{r_y} \rvert$$

By using this equation we get this result.

### Noise
#### Fractal Brownian Motion
Constructed from multiple layers of noise

Creates large features and fine detail

#### Domain warping
Each sample is offseted by value sampled from another noise function

Created ridge-like features

#### Distribution change
Remapping the values from "linear" function to "exponential" one, we can achive wider valleys and steeper mountains

#### Creese
So far, the noise function was normalized to that is was in the range (0, 1). The original noise function has values in the range (-1, 1). By taking the absolute value of said function, we can achieve ridges similar to domain-warping technique.

#### Future
Combine multple terrain functions based on biomes inside the terrain.
